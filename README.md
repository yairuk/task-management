# TaskManagement

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## UX

the project have 2 tabs: 
1. tasks list - shows all the main tasks and subtasks
2. statistics for the status of the tasks

by clicking on the add task you can create new task
by clicking on the task edit button you can edit/delete him or his subtasks 
to add subtask for to the task - enter to wanted task and add sub task

## UI

I used with bootstap - 4 for quickly and simple design

## Things to improve:
  * UI/UX - more clean design(nice way to show the sub-sub tasks - now i show them only on the subtask edit page)
  * form validations - add validations for the title,description fields  - now i can save task with those fields empty
  * Unitests - add more UT for more robust app
  * types - add more types - for clean and robust code
